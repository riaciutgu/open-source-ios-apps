- [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) or higher (Windows 10 already has it).
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2019 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

2. Extract the zip file and copy the ScriptHookVDotNet.asi, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll files into your GTA 5 game directory (where GTA5.exe is located).
3. Create a folder named "scripts" in your GTA 5 game directory (if it does not exist already).

## Tips and Tricks
