But what can you expect from the next version of Illustrator, which is rumored to be released in the first half of 2013? Here are some of the features that we hope to see in Adobe Illustrator CS7:
 
- **Autosave:** One of the most requested features by Illustrator users is autosave, which would save your work automatically at regular intervals and prevent you from losing hours of work due to a crash or power outage. Photoshop CS6 and InDesign CS6 already have this feature, so it's time for Illustrator to catch up.
- **Better brushes:** Another common complaint about Illustrator is the lack of quality brushes that come with the software. Many of the default brushes are tacky and unusable for professional work. We hope that Adobe will provide more creative and realistic brushes that can enhance your vector artwork.
- **3D improvements:** Illustrator has a 3D effect tool that allows you to create basic 3D objects and apply extrude, bevel, and rotate effects. However, this tool is outdated and limited compared to other 3D applications. We hope that Adobe will improve the interface and render engine of the 3D effect tool and add more features such as lighting, shading, and texture mapping.

These are just some of the features that we would like to see in Adobe Illustrator CS7. Of course, there are many more possibilities and improvements that could make Illustrator even better. What are your thoughts? What features do you want to see in the next version of Illustrator? Let us know in the comments below.

- **Pattern creation:** Illustrator CS6 introduced a new pattern creation engine that allows you to create seamless and editable patterns with ease. However, some users have reported bugs and glitches with this feature, such as patterns disappearing or shifting when zooming or saving. We hope that Adobe will fix these issues and make pattern creation more reliable and intuitive in CS7.
- **Variable fonts:** Variable fonts are a new type of font that allows you to adjust various aspects of the font, such as weight, width, slant, and optical size, with sliders. This gives you more flexibility and control over your typography and reduces the need for multiple font files. Variable fonts are already supported by Photoshop CC 2023 and InDesign CC 2023, so we hope that Illustrator CS7 will also add this feature.
- **Illustrator on iPad:** Adobe has announced that it is working on bringing Illustrator to the iPad, following the success of Photoshop on iPad. This would enable users to create and edit vector graphics on the go, using touch and Apple Pencil. Adobe has not revealed a release date for Illustrator on iPad yet, but we hope that it will coincide with the launch of CS7.

These are some more features that we would like to see in Adobe Illustrator CS7. Of course, there are many other possibilities and improvements that could make Illustrator even better.
